Known Bugs
---------------
- Particle Spawners seem to stop emitting after spawning a certain number of particles
- Mouse look generates some camera shake, the algorithm to calculate rotations is poorly designed
- Missile Follow is broken
- textures are assigning two references when they are attached to a mesh (mesh and sound objects also likely exhibit this behavior)
- validation checks on texture, mesh and sound loading is entering the failure condition no matter what value is returned
- including comments inside super dumb script files may cause that file to be skipped and not added into memory
- script loading lacks any form of exception handeling for missing files or missing variables or invalid variables
